# Screencast Link
Because the screencast is too big to upload to GitHub, the screencast link has been uploaded to my Google Drive that anyone with the link can view: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EvcXCnpzLgAs-sp5X-RCQjKi8tSkCMGA/view?usp=sharing 

# Pipeline
I've uploaded the pipeline script however my AWS credentials are not set up with this repository and is only set up with my repository from the screencast. Link To Screencast Repository: https://github.com/IsaiahA17/SikrakenDevOps
